![A 3D rotating scatterplot that shows all the metro line colors in the dataset of interest along with the average color and outlier colors.](portfolio-media/02-01-2022_1.gif)

**Date**: 02-01-2022
**Type**: Dynamic, 3D
**Taken from**: Assignment [(Analyzing Metro lines around the world)](https://github.com/ejgenc/data-analysis_city-lines)
**Context**: This 3D rotating scatterplot is taken from an assignment completed for the MSc Digital Humanities programme offered by KU Leuven. The visualization plots all the metro line colors in the dataset of interest, with added emphasis on the "average" color and outlier colors.
**Tools used**: Python, Matplotlib

![A horizontally-oriented, stylized 2D stacked bar chart that shows the most dominant metro line color(s) for each country.](portfolio-media/02-01-2022_2.png)

**Date**: 02-01-2022
**Type**: Static, 2D
**Taken from**: Assignment [(Analyzing metro lines around the world)](https://github.com/ejgenc/data-analysis_city-lines)
**Context**: This horizontally-oriented, stylized 2D stacked bar chart is taken from an assignment completed for the MSc Digital Humanities programme offered by KU Leuven. The bar chart shows the most dominant line color(s) and the ratio by which they are the most dominant for each country that was represented in the dataset.
**Tools used**: Python, Matplotlib

![A dual-axis horizonal bar chart which plots the top twenty modifiers for the words "book" and "translation" in the dataset.](portfolio-media/09-06-2021.png)

**Date**: 09-06-2021
**Type**: Static, 2D
**Taken from**: Bachelor's paper [(Seeking traces of the translator's invisibility)](https://github.com/ejgenc/data-analysis_goodreads-translation-reviews)
**Context**: This dual-axis horizontal bar chart is taken from my Bachelor's graduation paper. In this figure the top twenty "modifiers" (adjectives) for the words "book" and "translation" are plotted along with their total occurence count and their emotional valence.
**Tools used**: Python, Matplotlib, Inkscape

![A conceptual network visualization which shows how each AirBnB rental in five districts of Istanbul, Turkey is located in relation to its nearest health tourism clinic.](portfolio-media/19-11-2020.png)

**Date**: 19-11-2020
**Type**: Static, 2D
**Taken from**: Personal project [(A tribute to my wrongness)](https://github.com/ejgenc/data-analysis_istanbul-health-tourism)
**Context**: This abstract map is taken from a personal data storytelling project I undertook in 2020. It was envisioned as a way to visually confirm that every AirBnB rental (blue dot) is properly matched with the nearest health tourism-related clinic (orange triangle).
**Tools used**: Python, Matplotlib, Inkscape

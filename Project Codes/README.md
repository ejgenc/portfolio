# Hello there!

## This repository holds the codes for each of my data analysis and visualizations projects. For my portfolio that explains these projects, please [refer to this link.](https://ejgenc.github.io/portfolio/) You can also look at individual folders to see source code / a little bit of explanation.

    # Personal Data Analysis/Science Project Template

This is a Cookiecutter template that i personally use for my data analysis/science projects. The template is based on a version of the ![DrivenData Cookiecutter Data Science project template.]("https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/") It is a heavily simplifed version that only includes tools that facilitate Readme file creation, environment creation and DAG structure implementation.

## Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```


## To start a new project, run:
